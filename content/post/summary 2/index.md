# As a student in the past week, I likely engaged in various activities. These may include:
 Last week, the weather was quite pleasant. I went for a nice walk outside on several occasions. The temperatures were mild and the skies were mostly sunny, making it a great time to get some fresh air and exercise. I enjoyed being able to comfortably walk around the neighborhood and take in the sights and sounds of the outdoors. The nice weather made the walks very enjoyable. Overall, it was a pleasant and productive week, with the good weather allowing me to spend time outdoors on foot. The walking was a great way to stay active and take advantage of the favorable conditions.
